# Jiggly beta

The Jiggly beta's purpose is to identify potential issues with the smart contract in a live environment that are difficult to cover with automated tests.

__The beta is only available to the first 500 participants.__

Participating is completely free.

## Beta Tokenomics

The beta program runs on the Polygon network and uses a dummy GLY-USD token to serve as the initial registered liquidity pool. This token has a full supply of 200 000 tokens of which 100 000 is put into the liquidity pool.

The GLY-BETA token has a supply of 250 000 tokens of which 100 000 is put into the liquidity pool, and 150 000 is added to the reward pool.

## Timeline

The beta runs for a few weeks during which all key aspects of the contract are to be put to the test.

### Segment length

The beta program's segment length is 10 times slower than the eventual token (5 hours instead of 30 minutes). This is due to the fact that the volume during the beta is expected to be far lower than once the live token launches and gives more time for testers to play around.

## Participation

To participate in the beta, send an email to [theduck@jiggly.app](mailto:theduck@jiggly.app) (or DM @JigglyTheDuck on Telegram) with your ethereum wallet address.

200 GLY-USD tokens will be sent to this address.

Once you have your GLY-USD tokens, you can get your GLY by trading the liquidity pool.

The distribution process is manual so it may take up to 8 hours to process your request.

### Rewards

Beta testers will altogether earn 500 000 tokens distributed in proportion to their contribution during the program. (contributions are calculated by the amount of claimed rewards during the beta).

The token rewards will be claimable by the same wallet as soon as the token launches.

## Sample song

The initial song during the beta we are trying to compose is this one:

It consists of 64 segments resulting in 320 hours of composition.
