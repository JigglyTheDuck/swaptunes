# Jiggly Beta

The purpose of the Jiggly beta is to identify potential issues with the smart contract in a live environment that are difficult to detect through automated tests.

__The beta is limited to the first 500 participants.__

Participation is completely free.

## Beta Tokenomics

The beta program runs on the Polygon network and uses a dummy GLY-USD token as the initial registered liquidity pool. This token has a total supply of 200,000 tokens, with 100,000 tokens allocated to the liquidity pool.

The GLY-BETA token has a supply of 250,000 tokens, with 100,000 tokens allocated to the liquidity pool and 150,000 tokens added to the reward pool.

## Timeline

The beta will run for a few weeks, during which all key aspects of the contract will be tested.

### Segment Length

The beta program's segment length is 10 times slower than the eventual token (5 hours instead of 30 minutes). This is due to the expected lower volume during the beta, providing testers with more time to experiment.

## Participation

To participate in the beta, send an email to [theduck@jiggly.app](mailto:theduck@jiggly.app) or DM @JigglyTheDuck on Telegram with your Ethereum wallet address.

200 GLY-USD tokens will be sent to this address.

Once you have your GLY-USD tokens, you can acquire GLY by trading in the liquidity pool.

The distribution process is manual, so it may take up to 8 hours to process your request.

### Rewards

Beta testers will collectively earn 500,000 tokens, distributed in proportion to their contributions during the program (contributions are calculated based on the amount of claimed rewards during the beta).

The token rewards will be claimable by the same wallet as soon as the token launches.

## Sample Song

The initial song we aim to compose during the beta is:

[https://jiggly.app/?previewTrack=AQQUaRMyYnaXanaXZ3aXYnaXZ3aXYHZ3ZXZHYHMWl3AIiA#composer](https://jiggly.app/?previewTrack=AQQUaRMyYnaXanaXZ3aXYnaXZ3aXYHZ3ZXZHYHMWl3AIiA#composer)

It consists of 64 segments, resulting in 320 hours of composition.
